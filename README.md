# Server-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

This project is about creating an app that allows users to see the weather forecast for cities of their choosing. **I learnt a lot in this project and I feel like my understanding of HTML, CSS, Github and Github Pages has really improved.** I am becoming quicker at debugging my code and know some of the common errors to check first, such as missing divs. My confidence is improving. Bootstrap has been a really interesting topic to learn about and I am looking forward to using it in future projects. This portfolio highlights my work to date as well as the thought processes behind it. This portfolio will be added to and developed as my own personal knowledge deepens and I have more projects to showcase to potential employers.

Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your Challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.


## User Story

- **AS** a traveler
- **I WANT** to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

## Acceptance Criteria

- **WHEN** viewing weather dashboard
- **THEN** the user is presented with form inputs
- **WHEN** a user searches for a city
- **THEN** they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
- **WHEN** a user views the current weather conditions for that city 
- **THEN** they are presented with: the city name; the date; an icon representation of weather conditions; the temperature; the humidity; the wind speed
- **WHEN** a user views future weather conditions for that city
- **THEN** they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:the date; an icon representation of weather conditions; the temperature; the humidity; the wind speed
- **WHEN**  a user clicks on a city in the search history
- **THEN** they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
